Here is a quick list of things to do to get started, ideally before the first course:
- Install [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/). Here are a few example videos on how to do this:

- Install all required packages by using the script provided by Brian High. Simply typing 
```r 
source("installallpkgs.R")
``` 
in the R studio should work.
As an alternative you can also also click on the `source` button in RStudio.

- If you have never used R before, please have a look at the following material and links from Rstudio: http://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/

In particular, you should go through the following R tutorial: http://tryr.codeschool.com/ and/or the R course provided by DataCamp: https://www.datacamp.com/

You can also look at the R package `swirl`, which provides an interactive introduction to R. The (swirl website)[http://swirlstats.com/students.html], also provides basic information on how to get started
with R and in particular install R and RStudio.
